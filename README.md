### Project Plan: Solana Fork with Torus-Core-Inspired Reward Algorithm

---

#### **Project Objective:**  
Create a fork of the Solana network with a modified reward algorithm that distributes a 5% yearly reward based on user holdings, inspired by the Torus-Core network.

---

### **Main Tasks:**

1. **Project Setup and Planning**  
   - Define the scope, timeline, and resources required.  
   - Assign roles and responsibilities to the team.  
   - Set up version control (e.g., GitHub repository) and project management tools.  

2. **Fork Solana Network**  
   - Clone the official Solana repository: [Solana GitHub](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana).  
   - Set up the development environment (Rust, dependencies, and tools).  
   - Test the forked network to ensure it runs correctly without modifications.  

3. **Analyze Torus-Core Reward Mechanism**  
   - Study the Torus-Core GitHub repository: [Torus-Core GitHub](https://github.com/torus-economy/torus-core).  
   - Understand the reward distribution logic (e.g., percentage calculation, distribution intervals).  
   - Identify any dependencies or constraints for integration into Solana.  

4. **Design the Modified Reward Algorithm**  
   - Define the 5% yearly reward distribution mechanism.  
   - Determine how user holdings will be calculated and verified.  
   - Ensure compatibility with Solana's existing staking and validator mechanisms.  

5. **Implement the Reward Algorithm**  
   - Modify Solana's staking program to incorporate the new reward mechanism.  
   - Write Rust code for calculating and distributing rewards based on holdings.  
   - Implement security checks to prevent manipulation or abuse.  

6. **Testing and Validation**  
   - Set up a testnet for the modified Solana fork.  
   - Test the reward distribution mechanism under various scenarios (e.g., different holdings, validator behavior).  
   - Perform security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities.  

7. **Deployment**  
   - Prepare the fork for mainnet deployment.  
   - Create a deployment script and documentation for validators and users.  

8. **Documentation and Support**  
   - Document the changes made to the codebase, including the new reward algorithm.  
   - Provide guidelines for validators and users to transition to the fork.  
   - Offer support for troubleshooting and maintenance.  

---

### **Technical Considerations:**

1. **Compatibility with Solana:**  
   - Ensure the new reward mechanism integrates seamlessly with Solanaâ€™s consensus protocol (Proof of History/Proof of Stake).  
   - Maintain support for existing wallets, validators, and smart contracts.  

2. **Reward Calculation Logic:**  
   - Develop a formula for calculating 5% yearly rewards based on user holdings.  
   - Consider how frequently rewards will be distributed (e.g., daily, weekly).  

3. **Security Measures:**  
   - Implement safeguards to prevent double-counting or reward manipulation.  
   - Use cryptographic proofs to ensure transparency in reward distribution.  

4. **Performance Optimization:**  
   - Optimize the reward calculation process to minimize impact on network performance.  
   - Test for scalability to handle a large number of users and transactions.  

5. **Documentation:**  
   - Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the fork.  
   - Include examples and FAQs to help users understand the new reward system.
